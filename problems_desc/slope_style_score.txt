Problem: Slope style score

Slope style featured as a new snowboarding discipline in the Sochi 2014 Winter
Olympics.
To get a medal, you need to get maximum score from the judges.
All judges give you a score - a floating point number between 0 and 100. When all
scores are given, the final score is calculated by the following algorithm:
Remove the largest and the smallest scores. From the rest, take the average.
Implement a function, called slope_style_score(scores) where scores is a list of
floating point numbers.
The function should calculate and return the final score, according to the algorithm
above.
The final score should be rounded to two decimal points. This means that if we get a
score 94.66666666666667 it should be rounded to 94.66

Test examples:

>>> slope_style_score([94, 95, 95, 95, 90])
94.66
>>> slope_style_score([60, 70, 80, 90, 100])
80.0
>>> slope_style_score([96, 95.5, 93, 89, 92])
93.5

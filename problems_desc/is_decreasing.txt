Problem: Descreasing sequence?

Implement a function, called is_decreasing(seq) where seq is a list of integers.
The function should return True, if the given sequence is monotonously decreasing.
And before you skip this problem, because of the math terminology, let me explain:
A sequence is monotonously decreasing if for every two elements a and b, that
are next to each other (a is before b), we have a > b.
For example, [5,4,3,2,1] is monotonously decreasing, but [1,2,3,4,5,1] is not.


Signature:
def is_decreasing(n):
    pass

Test examples:

>>> is_decreasing([5,4,3,2,1])
True
>>> is_decreasing([1,2,3])
False
>>> is_decreasing([100, 50, 20])
True
>>> is_decreasing([1,1,1,1])
False
